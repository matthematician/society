<li><blockquote class="blockquote"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A restaurant in New York tiled their floor with pennies<a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-18-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.1.18"><sup> 18 </sup></a>. Just for the materials, is this more expensive than using a more traditional material like ceramic tiles? If each penny has to be laid by hand, estimate how long it would take to lay the pennies for a 12ft by 10ft room. Considering material and labor costs, are pennies a cost-effective replacement for ceramic tiles?</p></blockquote></li>

Which diet is more cost effective based on your eating habits?</p></blockquote></li>
