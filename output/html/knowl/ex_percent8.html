<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A Seattle Times article on high school graduation rates reported “The number of schools graduating 60 percent or fewer students in four years – sometimes referred to as “dropout factories” – decreased by 17 during that time period. The number of kids attending schools with such low graduation rates was cut in half.”</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">a) Is the “decrease by 17” number a useful comparison?</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">b) Considering the last sentence, can we conclude that the number of “dropout factories” was originally 34?</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">a) This number is hard to evaluate, since we have no basis for judging whether this is a larger or small change. If the number of “dropout factories” dropped from 20 to 3, that’d be a very significant change, but if the number dropped from 217 to 200, that’d be less of an improvement.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">b) The last sentence provides relative change which helps put the first sentence in perspective. We can estimate that the number of “dropout factories” was probably previously around 34. However, it’s possible that students simply moved schools rather than the school improving, so that estimate might not be fully accurate.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_percents.html#ex_percent8">in-context</a></span>
