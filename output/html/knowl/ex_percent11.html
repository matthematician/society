<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">It is very tempting to average these values, and claim the overall average is 35%, but this is likely not correct, since most players make many more 2-point attempts than 3-point attempts.</p>
<p>We don’t actually have enough information to answer the question. Suppose the player attempted 200 2-point field goals and 100 3-point field goals. Then they made \(200(0.40) = 80\) 2-point shots and \(100(0.30) = 30\) 3-point shots. Overall, they made 110 shots out of 300, for a</p>
