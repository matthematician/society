		<title>Sets</title>

        <introduction>
		    <p>
			It is natural for us to classify items into groups, or sets, and consider how those sets overlap with each other. We can use these sets understand relationships between groups, and to analyze survey data.

				An art collector might own a collection of paintings, while a music lover might keep a collection of CDs. Any collection of items can form a <term>set</term>.

                <title>Set</title>
			    <p>
				    A <term>set</term> is a collection of distinct objects, called <term>elements</term> of the set.
			    </p>
            </definition>

			<p>
				A set can be defined by describing the contents, or by listing the elements of the set, enclosed in curly brackets.
			</p>

			<remark xml:id="ex_sets1">
			<p>
				Some examples of sets defined by describing the contents:
			</p>

			<p>
				a) The set of all even numbers
			</p>

			<p>
				b) The set of all books written about travel to Chile
			</p>

			<p>
				Some examples of sets defined by listing the elements of the set:
			</p>

			<p>
				a) {1, 3, 9, 12}
			</p>

			<p>
				b) {red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, purple}
			</p>
            </remark>

			<p>
				A set simply specifies the contents; order is not important. The set represented by {1, 2, 3} is equivalent to the set {3, 1, 2}.

            <definition xml:id="def_setnotation"><title>Notation for Sets</title>
                <p>
                    Commonly, we will use a variable to represent a set, to make it easier to refer to that set later.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The symbol <m>\in</m> means <q>is an element of</q>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A set that contains no elements, <m>\{\; \}</m>, is called the <term>empty set</term> and is notated <m>\emptyset</m>.
                </p>
            </definition>

            <remark xml:id="ex_setnotation">
                <p>
                    Let <m>A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}.</m>
                </p>

                <p>
                    To notate that 2 is element of the set, we’d write <m>2\in A</m>.
                </p>
            </remark>

			<p>
				Sometimes a collection might not contain all the elements of a set. For example, Chris owns three Madonna albums. While Chris’s collection is a set, we can also say it is a <q>subset</q> of the larger set of all Madonna albums.

            <definition xml:id="def_subset"><title>Subset</title>
                <p>
                    A <term>subset</term> of a set <m>A</m> is another set that contains only elements from the set <m>A</m>, but may not contain all the elements of <m>A</m>.
                </p>

                <p>

                <p>
                    A <term>proper subset</term> is a subset that is not identical to the original set – it contains fewer elements.
                </p>

                <p>

                    There are many possible answers here. One would be the set of plays by Shakespeare. This is also a subset of the set of all plays ever written. It is also a subset of all British literature.

				Notice that in the example above, it would be hard to just ask for <m>A^c</m>, since everything from the color fuchsia to puppies and peanut butter are included in the complement of the set. For this reason, complements are usually only used with intersections, or when we have a universal set in place.

                    A <term>universal set</term> is a set that contains all the elements we are interested in. This would have to be defined by the context.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A complement is relative to the universal set, so <m>A^c</m> contains all the elements in the universal set that are not in <m>A</m>.

                    Suppose the universal set is <me> U = \text{all whole numbers from 1 to 9}.</me> If <m>A=\{1, 2, 4\}</m>, then <me> A^c = \{3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}. </me>

			<p>
				As we saw earlier with the expression <m>A^c\cap C</m>, set operations can be grouped together. Grouping symbols can be used like they are with arithmetic – to force an order of operations.
