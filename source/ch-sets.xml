		<title>Sets</title>

        <introduction>
		    <p>
			It is natural for us to classify items into groups, or sets, and consider how those sets overlap with each other. We can use these sets understand relationships between groups, and to analyze survey data.

				An art collector might own a collection of paintings, while a music lover might keep a collection of CDs. Any collection of items can form a <term>set</term>.

                <title>Set</title>
			    <p>
				    A <term>set</term> is a collection of distinct objects, called <term>elements</term> of the set.
			    </p>
            </definition>

			<p>
				A set can be defined by describing the contents, or by listing the elements of the set, enclosed in curly brackets.
			</p>

			<remark xml:id="ex_sets1">
			<p>
				Some examples of sets defined by describing the contents:
			</p>

			<p>
				a) The set of all even numbers
			</p>

			<p>
				b) The set of all books written about travel to Chile
			</p>

			<p>
				Some examples of sets defined by listing the elements of the set:
			</p>

			<p>
				a) {1, 3, 9, 12}
			</p>

			<p>
				b) {red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, purple}
			</p>
            </remark>

			<p>
				A set simply specifies the contents; order is not important. The set represented by {1, 2, 3} is equivalent to the set {3, 1, 2}.

            <definition xml:id="def_setnotation"><title>Notation for Sets</title>
                <p>
                    Commonly, we will use a variable to represent a set, to make it easier to refer to that set later.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The symbol <m>\in</m> means <q>is an element of</q>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A set that contains no elements, <m>\{\; \}</m>, is called the <term>empty set</term> and is notated <m>\emptyset</m>.
                </p>
            </definition>

            <remark xml:id="ex_setnotation">
                <p>
                    Let <m>A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}.</m>
                </p>

                <p>
                    To notate that 2 is element of the set, we’d write <m>2\in A</m>.
                </p>
            </remark>

			<p>
				Sometimes a collection might not contain all the elements of a set. For example, Chris owns three Madonna albums. While Chris’s collection is a set, we can also say it is a <q>subset</q> of the larger set of all Madonna albums.

            <definition xml:id="def_subset"><title>Subset</title>
                <p>
                    A <term>subset</term> of a set <m>A</m> is another set that contains only elements from the set <m>A</m>, but may not contain all the elements of <m>A</m>.
                </p>

                <p>

                <p>
                    A <term>proper subset</term> is a subset that is not identical to the original set – it contains fewer elements.
                </p>

                <p>

                    There are many possible answers here. One would be the set of plays by Shakespeare. This is also a subset of the set of all plays ever written. It is also a subset of all British literature.

				Notice that in the example above, it would be hard to just ask for <m>A^c</m>, since everything from the color fuchsia to puppies and peanut butter are included in the complement of the set. For this reason, complements are usually only used with intersections, or when we have a universal set in place.

                    A <term>universal set</term> is a set that contains all the elements we are interested in. This would have to be defined by the context.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A complement is relative to the universal set, so <m>A^c</m> contains all the elements in the universal set that are not in <m>A</m>.

				As we saw earlier with the expression <m>A^c\cap C</m>, set operations can be grouped together. Grouping symbols can be used like they are with arithmetic – to force an order of operations.

			<p>
				To visualize the interaction of sets, John Venn in 1880 thought to use overlapping circles, building on a similar idea used by Leonhard Euler in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. These illustrations are now called Venn diagrams.

			<definition xml:id="def_venn">
                <p>
                    A Venn diagram represents each set by a circle, usually drawn inside of a containing box representing the universal set. Overlapping areas indicate elements common to both sets.
                </p>
            </definition>

			<p>
				Basic Venn diagrams can illustrate the interaction of two or three sets.

                    A survey asks 200 people “What beverage do you drink in the morning”, and offers choices:
                </p>

                                <p>
                    Coffee only

                    Suppose 20 report tea only, 80 report coffee only, 40 report both. How many people drink tea in the morning? How many people drink neither tea or coffee?

                    This question can most easily be answered by creating a Venn diagram. We can see that we can find the people who drink tea by adding those who drink only tea to those who drink both: 60 people.<line/>
                
                    We can also see that those who drink neither are those not contained in the any of the three other groupings, so we can count those by subtracting from the cardinality of the universal set, 200.<line/>
                
                    <m>200 – 20 – 80 – 40 = 60</m> people who drink neither.

                <p>
                    The results show 40% of those surveyed have used Twitter, 70% have used Facebook, and 20% have used both. How many people have used neither Twitter or Facebook?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let <m>T</m> be the set of all people who have used Twitter, and <m>F</m> be the set of all people who have used Facebook. Notice that while the cardinality of <m>F</m> is 70% and the cardinality of <m>T</m> is 40%, the cardinality of <m>F\cup T</m> is not simply <m>70\% + 40\%</m>, since that would count those who use both services twice. 
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    To find the cardinality of <m>F\cup T</m>, we can add the cardinality of <m>F</m> and the cardinality of <m>T</m>, then subtract those in intersection that we’ve counted twice. In symbols,
                    <md><mrow>n(F\cup T) &amp;= n(F) + n(T) - n(F\cap T)</mrow><mrow>n(F\cup T) &amp;= 70\% + 40\% - 20\% = 90\%.</mrow></md>
                </p>

            
                <p>
                    Now, to find how many people have not used either service, we’re looking for the cardinality of <m>(F\cup T)^c</m> . Since the universal set contains 100% of people and the cardinality of <m>F\cup T</m> is 90%, the cardinality of <m>(F\cup T)^c</m> must be the other 10%.

                    It might help to look at a Venn diagram.
                
                    From the given data, we know that there are
                
                    3 students in region <m>e</m> and
                
                    7 students in region <m>h</m>.

                <image source="images/sets/ex_surv3.png" width="40%"/>
                </sidebyside>

                <p>
                    Since 7 students were taking a SS and NS course, we know that <m>n(d)+n(e) = 7</m>. Since we know there are 3 students in region 3, there must be <me>7 – 3 = 4 \text{ students in region }d.</me>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Similarly, since there are 10 students taking HM and NS, which includes regions <em>e</em> and <em>f</em>, there must be <me>10 – 3 = 7 \text{ students in region }f.</me>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since 9 students were taking SS and HM, there must be <m>9 – 3 = 6 </m>students in region <em>b</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, we know that 21 students were taking a SS course. This includes students from regions <em>a, b, d,</em> and <em>e</em>. Since we know the number of students in all but region <em>a</em>, we can determine that <me>21 – 6 – 4 – 3 = 8 \text{ students are in region }a.</me>
                </p>

                <p>

                            Starting with the intersection of all three circles, we work our way out. Since 10 people believe in UFOs and Ghosts, and 2 believe in all three, that leaves 8 that believe in only UFOs and Ghosts. We work our way out, filling in all the regions. Once we have, we can add up all those regions, getting 91 people in the union of all three sets. This leaves <m>150 – 91 = 59</m> who believe in none.
