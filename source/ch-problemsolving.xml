    <title>Problem Solving</title>

	<introduction>
		<p>
			In previous math courses, you’ve no doubt run into the infamous <q>word problems.</q> Unfortunately, these problems rarely resemble the type of problems we actually encounter in everyday life. In math books, you usually are told exactly which formula or procedure to use, and are given exactly the information you need to answer the question. In real life, problem solving requires identifying an appropriate formula or procedure, and determining what information you will need (and won’t need) to answer the question.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this chapter, we will review several basic but powerful algebraic ideas: percents, rates, and proportions. We will then focus on the problem solving process, and explore how to use these ideas to solve problems where we don’t have perfect information.
		</p>

				In the 2004 vice-presidential debates, Edwards's claimed that US forces have suffered "90% of the coalition casualties" in Iraq. Cheney disputed this, saying that in fact Iraqi security forces and coalition allies "have taken almost 50 percent" of the casualties (<url href="http://www.factcheck.org/cheney_edwards_mangle_facts.html">Source</url>). Who is correct? How can we make sense of these numbers?
			</p>

			<p>
				<term>Percent</term> literally means <q>per 100,</q> or <q>parts per hundred.</q> When we write 40%, this is equivalent to the fraction <m>\frac{40}{100}</m> or the decimal 0.40. Notice that 80 out of 200 and 10 out of 25 are also 40%, since <m>\frac{80}{200} = \frac{10}{25} = \frac{40}{100}</m>.

			<video youtube="nygw69JqwoQ"/> <!-- Importance of Base in Percents -->

			<p>
				The base of a percent is very important. For example, while Nixon was president, it was argued that marijuana was a <q>gateway</q> drug, claiming that 80% of marijuana smokers went on to use harder drugs like cocaine. The problem is, this isn’t true. The true claim is that 80% of harder drug users first smoked marijuana. The difference is one of base: 80% of marijuana smokers using hard drugs, vs. 80% of hard drug users having smoked marijuana. These numbers are not equivalent. As it turns out, only one in 2,400 marijuana users actually go on to use harder drugs. (<url href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiesDamnedLiesAndStatistics">Source</url>)

					<p>
						There are about 75 QFC supermarkets in the U.S. Albertsons has about 215 stores. Compare the size of the two companies.
					</p>
					<p>
						When we make comparisons, we must ask first whether an absolute or relative comparison. The absolute difference is <me>215 – 75 = 140.</me> From this, we could say <q>Albertsons has 140 more stores than QFC.</q> However, if you wrote this in an article or paper, that number does not mean much. The relative difference may be more meaningful. There are two different relative changes we could calculate, depending on which store we use as the base:
					</p>
					<p>
						Using QFC as the base, <m> \frac{140}{75}=1.867.</m>
					</p>
					<p>
						This tells us Albertsons is 186.7% larger than QFC.
					</p>
					<p>
						Using Albertsons as the base, <m>\frac{140}{215}=0.651.</m>
					</p>
					<p>
						This tells us QFC is 65.1% smaller than Albertsons.
					</p>
					<p>
						Notice both of these are showing percent <em>differences</em>. We could also calculate the size of Albertsons relative to QFC: <m>\frac{215}{75}=2.867</m>, which tells us Albertsons is 2.867 times the size of QFC. Likewise, we could calculate the size of QFC relative to Albertsons: <m>\frac{75}{215}=0.349</m>, which tells us that QFC is 34.9% of the size of Albertsons.

						A Seattle Times article on high school graduation rates reported <q>The number of schools graduating 60 percent or fewer students in four years – sometimes referred to as <q>dropout factories</q> – decreased by 17 during that time period. The number of kids attending schools with such low graduation rates was cut in half.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						a) Is the <q>decrease by 17</q> number a useful comparison?
					</p>

					<p>
						b) Considering the last sentence, can we conclude that the number of <q>dropout factories</q> was originally 34?
					</p>
					<p>
						a) This number is hard to evaluate, since we have no basis for judging whether this is a larger or small change. If the number of <q>dropout factories</q> dropped from 20 to 3, that’d be a very significant change, but if the number dropped from 217 to 200, that’d be less of an improvement.
					</p>

					<p>
						b) The last sentence provides relative change which helps put the first sentence in perspective. We can estimate that the number of <q>dropout factories</q> was probably previously around 34. However, it’s possible that students simply moved schools rather than the school improving, so that estimate might not be fully accurate.

						Without more information, it is hard for us to judge who is correct, but we can easily conclude that these two percents are talking about different things, so one does not necessarily contradict the other.

						In the 2012 presidential elections, one candidate argued that <q>the president’s plan will cut $716 billion from Medicare, leading to fewer services for seniors,</q> while the other candidate rebuts that <q>our plan does not cut current spending and actually expands benefits for seniors, while implementing cost saving measures.</q> Are these claims in conflict, in agreement, or not comparable because they’re talking about different things?

				<answer>
					<p>Without more information, it is hard to judge these arguments. This is compounded by the complexity of Medicare. As it turns out, the $716 billion is not a cut in current spending, but a cut in future increases in spending, largely reducing future growth in health care payments. In this case, at least the numerical claims in both statements could be considered at least partially true.

				We’ll wrap up our review of percents with a couple cautions. First, when talking about a change of quantities that are already measured in percents, we have to be careful in how we describe the change.

						We could describe this using an absolute change: <me>\bigl| 50\% - 40\% \bigr| = 10\%.</me> Notice that since the original quantities were percents, this change also has the units of percent. In this case, it is best to describe this as an increase of 10 <term>percentage points</term>.
					</p>
					<p>
						In contrast, we could compute the percent change: <me> \frac{10\%}{40\%} = 0.25 = 25\% \text{ increase.}</me> This is the relative change, and we’d say the politician’s support has increased by 25%.

						Solve the proportion <m>\displaystyle\frac{5}{3} = \displaystyle\frac{x}{6}</m> for the unknown value <em>x</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						This proportion is asking us to find a fraction with denominator 6 that is equivalent to the fraction <m>\frac53</m>. We can solve this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 6, giving <me>x = \frac53 \cdot 6 = 10.</me>

				<statement>
					<p>
						A map scale indicates that <m>\frac12</m> inch on the map corresponds with 3 real miles. How many miles apart are two cities that are <m>2\frac14</m>inches apart on the map?
					</p>
					<p>
						We can set up a proportion by setting equal two rates, and introducing a variable, <em>x</em>, to represent the unknown quantity – the mile distance between the cities.
					</p>
					<md>
						<mrow> \frac{ \frac12 \text{ map inch}}{ 3 \text{ miles}} &amp;= \frac{ 2\frac14 \text{ map inch}}{ x \text{ miles}} &amp; \text{Multiply both sides by }x </mrow>
						<mrow> &amp;&amp; \text{and rewrite the mixed number}</mrow>
						<mrow> \frac{ 1/2 }{3} \cdot x &amp;= \frac94 &amp; \text{Multiply both sides by 3}</mrow>
						<mrow>\frac12 x &amp;= \frac{27}{4} &amp; \text{Multiply both sides by 2 (or divide by }\frac12 \text{)}</mrow>
						<mrow>x &amp;= \frac{27}{2} = 13\frac12 \text{ miles}.</mrow>

				Many proportion problems can also be solved using <term>dimensional analysis</term>, the process of multiplying a quantity by rates to change the units.

				<statement>
					<p>
						Your car can drive 300 miles on a tank of 15 gallons. How far can it drive on 40 gallons?
					</p>
					<p>
						We could certainly answer this question using a proportion: <me> \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ gallons}} = \frac{x \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ gallons}}.</me>
					</p>
					<p>
						However, we earlier found that 300 miles on 15 gallons gives a rate of 20 miles per gallon. If we multiply the given 40 gallon quantity by this rate, the <em>gallons</em> unit <q>cancels</q> and we’re left with a number of miles: <me>40\text{ gallons} \cdot \frac{20 \text{ miles}}{\text{gallon}} = \frac{40 \text{ gallons}}{1} \cdot \frac{20 \text{ miles}}{\text{gallon}} = 800 \text{ miles}.</me>
					</p>
					<p>
						Notice if instead we were asked <q>how many gallons are needed to drive 50 miles?</q> we could answer this question by inverting the 20 mile per gallon rate so that the <em>miles</em> unit cancels and we’re left with gallons: <me>50\text{ miles} \cdot \frac{1\text{ gallon}}{20\text{ miles}} = \frac{50\text{ miles}}{1} \cdot \frac{1\text{ gallon}}{20\text{ miles}} = \frac{50\text{ gallons}}{20} = 2.5\text{ gallons}.</me>
